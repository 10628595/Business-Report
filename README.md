Part of the new services offered by the advancement of cloud computing, cloud backup is a practical, efficient and secure solution. It assists in data management and security, in addition to providing several strategic advantages for companies.
Cloud systems work simply. There is an infrastructure of data centers in which resources are unified and distributed among several users according to the plans that were contracted. The service provider guarantees that its activities will not be interrupted by replicating the contents between several machines. In this way, it is possible to generate the maximum availability of functionalities for each user.
The main types of cloud solutions are:
public cloud
The public cloud is the most common model of cloud computing. In this case, the company will use a cloud computing infrastructure to share resources among all users. This way, it is possible to reduce costs and provide services to more people.
private cloud
The private cloud is aimed at companies that intend to use cloud computing applications with maximum control over how resources will be configured and used. In this type of cloud, only a single enterprise makes use of the cloud infrastructure, something that will directly impact costs and user experience.
hybrid cloud
The hybrid cloud is a cloud computing model that mixes characteristics of the private cloud with the public cloud to give the user maximum flexibility. Employees will have access to a more flexible infrastructure with greater potential for use. Thus, the company can create a smart and connected routine.
benefits and advantages
Investing in cloud computing can bring several benefits to the company. Migrating data to a cloud system brings more mobility to professionals, who will be able to use their IT infrastructure consuming fewer resources and reaching a higher level of performance. At the same time, the company will have simpler IT routines and will be able to rely on high-performance applications (such as Big Data) regardless of their size.
